# Solitons1D

Package developed by *Víctor Díaz Díaz* as part of the Ph.D. thesis *Rigorous and analytical approximation methods in soliton theories*.

This julia package allows for computations with 1-dimensional solitons (kinks and antikinks), both by solving the full field dynamics and solving the moduli space dynamics.

Current features:
- Full field dynamics for $\phi^4$ theory.
- Animation of KAK colissions using full field dynamics.

Pending features:
- Moduli space dynamics for 2-moduli models.
- Full field dynamics for sine-Gordon theory.
- Full field dynamics for $\phi^6$ theory.
