# Solitons1D

Package developed by *Víctor Díaz Díaz* as part of the Ph.D. thesis *Rigorous and analytical approximation methods in soliton theories*.

This julia package allows for computations with 1-dimensional solitons (kinks and antikinks), both by solving the full field dynamics and solving the moduli space dynamics.

Full Field (FF) features:
- Computations for $\phi^4$ theory.
- Collision plot for $\phi^4$ theory

Collective Coordinate Models (CCM) features:
- Moduli space dynamics for Poincaré + shape modes
- Moduli space dynamics for modified Poincaré + shape modes

Pending features:
- Full field dynamics for sine-Gordon theory.
- Full field dynamics for $\phi^6$ theory.
